# Ratebeer-Alko
Ratebeer overall rates to Alko.fi new webshop

Thanks to tistanos @https://github.com/tistatos/systembeer

This is a Google Chrome Extension to add Ratabeer rates to https://www.alko.fi/ and https://www.systembolaget.se/

You can download it from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ratebeer-loves-alko/miahmhdikjdonjbdfbllikpnlmfhcafg?hl=fi

Do not work in every beer in alko webstore. I am using beer name in webstorre to query beers from ratebeer. Some times names in alko are funny, like "Karhu t√∂lkki"
